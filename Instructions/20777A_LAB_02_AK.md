    ```

9.  On the **SQL** menu, click **Execute**, and then review the results of the query.

    **Question**: What different approaches to the document design did you consider; what are their advantages and disadvantages?
    
    **Answer**: The answer will depend on students' experience. You could create a document for each category containing the subcategories as sub-documents, and products as sub-sub-documents within each subcategory. However, this is probably not the best approach as the number of products in each category/subcategory is unbounded. The result would be a small number of very large documents and a solution that doesn't scale well.
    
    An alternative approach is to create a document for each product, and store category/subcategory information as properties within each product. This solution scales better. But you also need to consider how applications will let a user select category and subcategory information for performing searches. For example, if the user wants to search for products by subcategory, it would be useful to be able to present the user with a list of subcategories from which to make a selection. If this data is duplicated across many product documents, generating a list of categories and subcategories could be time consuming.
    
    **Question**: Will you store all the documents in one collection, or use more than one collection?
    
    **Answer**: The answer will depend on students' experience. The most optimal solution is to create two collections; one for products and another for category/subcategory information. Products can either be linked to the appropriate category/subcategory document - this would enable category/subcategory information to be easily updated as it is only held in one place -, or the category/subcategory data can be copied to each document - this would result in faster queries as each time a document is retrieved you don't need to perform an additional retrieval of category/subcategory information. Given that categories and subcategories don't change very often, and that the system must support fast querying, the best solution is to copy the data into each product.
    
    **Question**: The product data includes binary information in the form of Word documents and image files. How will you accommodate these files in Cosmos DB?
    
    **Answer**: The answer will depend on students' experience. This data is best held either as attachments in the Cosmos DB database, or in separate blob storage (you don't necessarily want to download this information every time you query a product). There is a limit on the amount of data you can hold as attachments in a collection, and there could be a large number of images and other objects referenced by products in the catalog, so the preferred solution is to store this data in Azure blob storage and add a URL that references the appropriate data to each product document.
    
    The products collection could have the following structure:
    
	```JSON
        {
            "id": "977",
            "productname": "Road-750 Black, 58",
            "productnumber": "BK-R19B-58",
            "color": "Black",
            "listprice": 539.99,
            "size": "58 Centimeter",
            "weight": "20.79 US pound",
            "quantityinstock": 153,
            "model": "Road-750",
            "description": "Entry level adult bike; offers a comfortable ride cross-country or down the block. Quick-release hubs and rims.",
            "productcategory": {
                "subcategory": "Road Bikes",
                "category": "Bikes"
            },
            "documentation": {
                "documenttitle": "Introduction 1",
                "documentsummary": "",
                "document": "<link to blob storage>"
            },
            "images": {
                "diagram": "",
                "thumbnail": "<link to blob storage>",
                "largephoto": "<link to blob storage>"
            }
        }
	```
    Documents in the category/subcategory collection could look like this. There is a document for each subcategory:
    
    ```JSON
        {
            "category": "Bikes",
            "subcategory": "Mountain Bikes",
        }
        
        {
            "category": "Bikes",
            "subcategory": "Road Bikes",
        }
    ```

10. Identify a partitioning strategy for the product data.

    **Question**: Assuming that the collection was going to scale to many millions of products, how would you partition the products collection?
    
    **Answer**: The answer will depend on students' experience. You could partition product data by `ProductNumber`, but this would lead to each product being stored in its own partition. Querying by category or subcategory would lead to many cross-partition queries, and this strategy would be very inefficient.
    
    Partitioning products by category would likely be too coarse a strategy as there are very few categories (4 currently)
    
    Partitioning products by subcategory will create more partitions to help distribute the load, while still reducing the likelihood of performing cross-partition queries.
    
    > **Note**: partitioning by subcategory could result in data skew (there is not an even distribution of products across subcategories, so some partitions will be bigger then others), is this a problem in this scenario? Probably not - the collection is query heavy (updates are far less frequent). Searches that locate products by subcategory will only need to scan a single partition. Using a different partition key could help to distribute updates more evenly, but would impact the response time of queries.
    
    **Question**: Will the product category/subcategory documents benefit from partitioning?
    
    **Answer**: The category/subcategory collection is very small and is unlikely to grow; it doesn't currently require partitioning. This strategy will also ensure that queries that generate a list of categories from the subcategory documents do not have to perform cross-partition searches.

#### Task 4: Create a Document Database Using the Cosmos DB SQL API

    <table class="table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <td>Product Number</td>
                <td>Product Name</td>
                <td>Model</td>
                <td></td>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        @foreach (var item in Model.Products)
        {
            <tr>
                <td>
                    @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.ProductNumber)
                </td>
                <td>
                    @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.ProductName)
                </td>
                <td>
                    @Html.DisplayFor(modelItem => item.Model)
                </td>
                <td>
                    @Html.ActionLink("Details", "GetProductDetails", new { productID = item.ProductID })

8.  In the **Product Name, Model Name, or Product Number** box, type **Wash**, and then click **Search By Product Name, Model Name, or Product Number**. You should now be presented with all products that contain the text **Wash** in the product number, name, or model.

9.  If you click the **Details** link for a product, the application will currently report an error because you haven't implemented the **GetProductDetails** method yet.

10. Close the web application and return to Visual Studio.

11. On the **ProductsController.cs** tab, after the second **FindProductsAsync** method (that you added earlier in this exercise), type the following code:

    ```csharp 
    // Method called to display the details of the specified product
    [ActionName("GetProductDetails")]
    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<ActionResult> GetProductDetailsAsync(string productID)
    {
        // Find the data for the specified product
        var products = await ProductsRepository<Product>.GetItemsAsync(p => p.ProductID == productID);
    
        // Display the details of the product
        return View(products.First());
    }
    ```

12. In Solution Explorer, expand **Views**, right-click **Products**, point to **Add**, and then click **View**.

    public static async Task<bool> CreateItem(T item)
    {
        // Add the new document to the collection
        Uri collectionUri = UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri(database, collection);
        var response = await client.CreateDocumentAsync(collectionUri, item);
    
        // Examine the status of the response, to determine whether the document was created successfully or not
        return response.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.Created;
    }
    ```

4.  Type the following code:

    ```csharp 
    public static async Task<int> IncrementNumericValueInDocumentAsync(string docID, string property, int value, string partitionKey = null)
    {
        // Fetch the doc to be updated
        Uri docUri = UriFactory.CreateDocumentUri(database, collection, docID);

        propVal += value;
        doc.SetPropertyValue(property, propVal);
    
        // Attempt to write the modified document back to the database
        // If another user modifies the same doc at the same time, this code will throw an exception back to the caller where it should be handled
        options = new RequestOptions
        {
            AccessCondition = new AccessCondition
            {
                Condition = doc.ETag,
                Type = AccessConditionType.IfMatch
            }
        };
        response = await client.ReplaceDocumentAsync(doc.SelfLink, doc, options);
    
        // Return the new value of the property that was updated
        return propVal;
    }
    ```
