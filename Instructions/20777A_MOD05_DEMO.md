## Lesson 2: Designing graph database models for efficient operations

### Demo 1: Designing efficient Gremlin queries

#### Preparation

You must have completed the previous demonstration, this should have created a movie graph database.

#### Task 1: Show how to download the graph explorer from the Azure Portal

1.  In Internet Explorer, on the **20777a-mod5-graph-\<your name\>-\<the day\>** blade, click **Quick start**.

2.  On the **Quick start** blade, on the **Guided Gremlin Tour** tab, in the **Add a graph** section, click  
    **Create ‘SalesGraph’ collection**.

#### Task 2: Try to compile and run the getting started graph explorer

1.  Press F5 to build and run the application.

2.  Note that the build fails and there are numerous errors. Explain that this code is supposed to be a starting point for development, and that it requires some updates to get fully working.

3.  In the **Microsoft Visual Studio** dialog box, click **No**.

4.  In Solution Explorer, expand **GraphExplorer**, expand **Controllers**, expand **Api**, and then double-click **GremlinController.cs**.

5.  In GremlinController.cs, note that this class is using **Microsoft.Azure.Graphs**, and that current best practice is to use the open source Gremlin.NET libraries to query a Cosmos DB graph.

6.  On the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.

7.  In the **Open Project** dialog box, go to **E:\\Demofiles\\Mod05\\GraphExplorer**, click **GraphExplorer.sln**, and then click **Open**.

2.  In appsettings.json, in the **endpoint** attribute, paste the **URI** value you noted earlier, replacing the text **enter URI here**.

3.  In the **authKey** attribute, paste the **Primary Key** value you noted earlier, replacing the text **enter Primary Key here**.

4.  In Internet Explorer, on the **20777a-mod5-graph-\<your name\>-\<the day\>** blade, click **Overview**.

5.  On the **Overview** blade, at the top right, copy the **Gremlin Endpoint**.

6.  In Visual Studio 2017, in the **gremlinURI** attribute, paste the **Gremlin Endpoint**, replacing the text **enter Gremlin Endpoint here**.

7.  In the **Gremlin Endpoint**, at the beginning of the string, delete the **https://**.

8.  In the **Gremlin Endpoint**, at the end of the string, delete the **:443/**.

9.  Press F5 to build and run the application.

10. In the **Microsoft Visual Studio** dialog box, click **Yes**.

11. In the **Security Warning** dialog box, click **Yes**.

12. Wait for the application to compile, and Internet Explorer to open.

#### Task 4: Examine the loaded graph

1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Execute**.

2.  This will take sometime, whilst the query is rendering, explain how the code is executing two queries against the graph. One to return all the vertices, and one to return all the edges. The application then builds the diagram from those two results. It is the building of the diagram (which is a node.js application) that is taking the time.

3.  Once the graph has been drawn, zoom in with the mouse wheel, and click on a **person**.

4.  On the right, the properties for this vertex are shown.

5.  In the **Set label property for Node Type** list, click **name**, and then click **Icon**.

6.  In the **Change icon** dialog box, click the person icon.

7.  On the graph, click a **movie**.

8.  In the **Set label property for Node Type** list, click **title**, and then click **Icon**.

9.  In the **Change icon** dialog box, click the movie icon.

10. Click the black box.

11. In the **Change color** dialog box, click a red color.

12. Zoom out to show the entire graph, then choose an area to zoom in.

13. Click an actors name, then follow the links to see the movies they acted in.

#### Task 5: Execute complex Gremlin queries

1.  In the text box, replace **g.V(); g.E()** with **g.V().hasLabel('person').as('director').out('Directed').as('movie').select('director').out('Acted in').where(eq('movie')).select('director','movie').by('name').by('title')**, and then click **Execute**.

2.  Note a graph hasn’t been drawn, the results are in GraphSON and are shown in a console dropdown:

    ```JSON  
    [
        {"director":"William Shatner","movie":"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"},      
        {"director":"Mel Gibson","movie":"Braveheart"},      
        {"director":"Leonard Nimoy","movie":"Star Trek III: The Search For Spock"},      
        {"director":"Leonard Nimoy","movie":"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"}
    ]
    ```
3.  On the toolbar, click **Internet Explorer** that contains the Azure portal.

4.  On **20777a-mod5-graph-\<your name\>-\<the day\>** blade, click **Data Explorer**.

5.  On the **Data Explorer** blade, expand **GraphDB**, expand **MovieGraph**, and then click **Scale & Settings**.

6.  On the **Scale & Settings** tab, change the **Throughput (1,000 - 50,000 RU/s)** box to **3000**, and the click **Save**.

7.  Return to the Graph explorer window, and then click **Execute**.

8.  The same results should be returned.

9.  In the text box, replace the query with the following code, and then click **Execute**:

    ``` 
    g.V().hasLabel('movie').as('movie').in('Directed').as('director').select('movie').in('Acted in').where(eq('director')).select('director','movie').by('name').by('title')
    ```

10. Note that an error has occurred, scroll through the log message until you find the following string:

    ```JSON 
    {\"Errors\":[\"Request rate is large\"]}
    ```

11. On the toolbar, click **Internet Explorer** that contains the Azure portal.

12. On the **Scale & Settings** tab, change the **Throughput (1,000 - 50,000 RU/s)** box to **6000**, and then click **Save**.

13. In Visual Studio 2017, on the **Debug** menu, click **Continue**.

14. In the Graph explorer window, click **Execute**.

15. The query should return the same actor / directors. Ask your students why the query failed at the lower throughput rate.

16. Also make note that even though the results are the same they are in a different order.

> This is the example in the topic **Optimizing Gremlin queries**. The first query starts the traversal at the person nodes and follows the **OUT** edges. Cosmos DB stores the out edges and their vertices in the same partition so that they are optimized for queries. The second query starts at movies, all their edges are **IN** and therefore are not stored in the same partitions. This makes the second query more expensive in terms of processing.

17. Choose two actors in the graph, and write a query that will find how they are related. Ensure you choose two actors who are in the graph.

18. For example, to find the relationship between **Kevin** and **Christopher**, use the following code, and then click **Execute**:

    ``` 
    g.V().has('name','Kevin Bacon').repeat(bothE().bothV().simplePath()).until(has('name','Christopher Walken')).path().limit(1).unfold()
    ```

19. In the bottom right, click **Configure Graph**.

20. In the **Configure graph** dialog box, select the **Show Edge Labels** check box, and note how both actors and directors have been used in the graph traversal.

21. Close Internet Explorer, and then close Visual Studio 2017.

#### Task 6: Demonstration clean up

1.  In the Azure portal, in the left pane, click Resource groups.

2.  On the Resource groups blade, right-click 20777aMod5, and then click Delete resource group.

3.  On the Are you sure you want to delete "20777aMod5"? blade, in the TYPE THE RESOURCE GROUP NAME box, type 20777aMod5, and then click Delete.
